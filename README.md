# Memory Dump-Based Malware Image Recognition Tool

## Overview
This project implements a **Memory Dump-Based Malware Image Recognition Tool** using **machine learning** techniques. It aims to analyze memory dumps and classify them into **benign** or **malicious** categories by converting them into image representations and applying deep learning models.

## Features
- Converts **memory dumps** into image representations.
- Applies **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to classify images.
- Includes **various model improvements** with different architectures.
- Provides detailed evaluation metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
